# Setting up the environment

If you want the latest version, we recommend creating a clean environment:

```commandline
conda create -n gwemopt python=3.11
git clone git@github.com:skyportal/gwemopt.git
pip install -e gwemopt
pre-commit install
```

or if you just want the latest version on Github:

```commandline
pip install gwemopt
```

If you run into dependency issues, you can try installing dependencies via conda:

```
conda install numpy scipy matplotlib astropy h5py shapely
conda install -c astropy astroquery
conda install -c conda-forge voeventlib astropy-healpix python-ligo-lw ligo-segments ligo.skymap ffmpeg
```

And then run `pip install -e gwemopt` again.

# Usage

Once installed, You can use gwemopt via the command line:

```commandline
gwemopt-run ....
```

where ... corresponds to the various arguments.
